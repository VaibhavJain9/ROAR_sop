# Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with ROAR

This repository contains the implementation of the Reinforcement Learning Based Online Active Learning (ROAR) algorithm for Human Activity Recognition (HAR). ROAR is an innovative approach that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) with online active learning to reduce human annotation effort while maintaining high classification accuracy.

## Overview

ROAR leverages the sequential nature of HAR data streams to make intelligent query decisions, optimizing human-provided annotations and enhancing HAR model performance. This implementation includes code for running ROAR on various HAR datasets and comparing its performance with other baseline methods.

## Usage

To run this code, please make sure to include the `modAL` folder, which is available in the [modAL GitHub repository](https://github.com/modAL-python/modAL).

## Datasets
The code provided here has been tested on the following datasets:

Emotion Detection (32 users)
CASE dataset (30 users)
K-emocon dataset (32 users)
User Study (36 users)

## Results
For detailed results and analysis, please refer to the report available in this repository.

Note
This repository is a part of a research project. For any questions or clarifications, please feel free to reach out.
